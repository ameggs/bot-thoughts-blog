= Handheld Portable Strobe =

This strobe is portable, tiny, battery-powered for calibrating the speed of all of your turntables and those of your pals.

Many turntables' strobes run off of gradually fluctuating mains frequency. Some don't have strobes at all. Get your deck's speed right and be sure with this tiny turntable strobe.

== Details ==

 * Runs on a tiny CR1225 battery
 * Bright white 5mm LED strobes at 60.00 Hz or 50.00 Hz
 * frequency error less than 0.005% or 0.03 Hz.
 * Tactile button to turn the strobe on
 * Use a 50Hz / 60Hz turntable check disk
 * 1" long, 3/4" wide, not counting LED

== How To Use ==

 * Install a CR1225 battery, matching + on battery to + on battery holder
 * Depress the tactile button to turn on
 * Print out a free strobe disc to match your strobe: [http://www.extremephono.com/ftp/60Hz.PDF 60Hz.PDF] or  [http://www.extremephono.com/ftp/50Hz.PDF 50Hz.PDF]
 * Cut out the strobe disc and punch a hole in the center
 * Place disc on platter like a record
 * Activate the turntable to begin spinning the platter
 * Select speed you want to adjust
 * Shine strobe light on..
    * the outer ring of marks for 33-1/3 rpm
    * the inner ring of marks for 45 rpm
 * Under the strobe
    * The ring will appear as individual marks
    * The individual marks may slowly move
 * Adjust turntable speed until marks stop moving (as applicable)
    * Read the turntable user manual for details
 * You may see the marks repeatedly move left and right a bit
    * That is called 'wow' and some tables have it worse than others

= Permanent Mount Retrofit Kit =

You can replace your old strobe with this kit, and a bit of ingenuity.

 * Runs from 5V supply, maximum
 * Features a bright white 5mm LED at 60.0 Hz
 * Frequency error less than 0.005% or 0.03 Hz.
 * Use your platter's existing strobe marks
 * 1" long, 7/8" wide, not counting LED

== Installation ==

DISCLAIMER: safely using this device is your responsibility. Please consult with a qualified individual before attempting to modify your turntable. Please install and power it safely.

 * Find a place to put the thing.
 * You can solder wires onto the LED and mount the module remotely.
 * You'll need a 5VDC power supply.
 * Connect/solder the 5VDC supply to the 5V/GND pins on the board.
 * Mount the board with #4 screws, hot glue, whatever works

== 45.0 RPM or 45.1 RPM? ==
Note that 45 RPM discs for 50.00 Hz strobes cannot exist; the number of dots required is not an integer. Instead, strobe patterns are typically 45.1 rpm. I have been told that some European "45 rpm" discs are actually cut at 45.1 rpm.
