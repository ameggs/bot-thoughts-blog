= Introduction =

Turntable strobe is a tiny, highly accurate, battery-powered strobe for calibrating the speed of your turntable. As in vinyl. Records. With the grooves.

Many turntables use mains frequency to run their strobes. While on average frequency from your outlet is 60 Hz (or 50 Hz depending), the frequency varies from hour to hour based on the load on the grid. Be sure with this tiny turntable strobe.

Other turntables lack a strobe altogether. Now you can check speed calibration easily with this strobe.

= Details =

 * Runs on a tiny CR1225 battery
 * Bright white 5mm LED strobes at 60.00 Hz or 50.00 Hz
 * frequency error less than 0.005% or 0.03 Hz.
 * Tactile button to turn the strobe on
 * Use a 50Hz / 60Hz turntable check disk
 * 1" long, 3/4" wide, not counting LED

Note that 45 RPM discs for 50.00 Hz strobes cannot exist; the number of dots required is not an integer. Instead, strobe patterns are typically 45.1 rpm. I have been told that some European "45 rpm" discs are actually cut at 45.1 rpm.

= How To Use =

 * Install a CR1225 battery, matching + on battery to + on battery holder
 * Depress the tactile button to turn on
 * Print out a free strobe disc to match your strobe: [http://www.extremephono.com/ftp/60Hz.PDF 60Hz.PDF] or  [http://www.extremephono.com/ftp/50Hz.PDF 50Hz.PDF]
 * Cut out the strobe disc and punch a hole in the center
 * Place disc on platter like a record
 * Activate the turntable to begin spinning the platter
 * Select speed you want to adjust
 * Shine strobe light on..
    * the outer ring of marks for 33-1/3 rpm
    * the inner ring of marks for 45 rpm
 * Under the strobe
    * The ring will appear as individual marks
    * The individual marks may slowly move

 * Adjust turntable speed until marks stop moving (as applicable)
    * Read the turntable user manual for details
 * You may see the marks repeatedly move left and right a bit
    * That is called 'wow' and some tables have it worse than others
